# BlazorBudgetApp
This is a personal project of mine inspired by my mom.
She is an accountant and she made me and my friends an incredible budgeting spreadsheet just using excel.
After using it for a long time, I had the idea to make it into an application of some kind. 
This is the result of that spreadsheet. It is a work in progress blazor application that will be updated slowly over time.
Why Blazor? I recently attended several lectures at VSLive San Diego and loved the look of the tech and the 
idea of having one language for both the front and back end of a web app. I have used VUE in a professional capacity, and although it is great,
I wanted to try something new for this project.
